If you are a Web Developer and you are wanting to, contributions are welcome right now, just be aware that if you submit a pull request it may take a while for me to review it. 
Forks of this project are encouraged. 
The full release may come with the release of "The Browser With Notes" or if that does not happen in a few years I may change this to a theme for somthing else with similar functionality? I don't know yet. :)
